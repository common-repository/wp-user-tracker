Slide-in Notification Bar, Targeted Adverts, Ajax Based Online Counter, Most Viewed Posts, Most Viewed Categories, 4 Unique Widget

== Description ==

 This plugin has a lot of function, but in my opinions, the best feature the plugin able to keep visitors on your website.
 How does it work? With a slide-in notification bar!

When someone had start to reading any post or page on your website, the other visitors will get a solid slide-in notification with a customizable text. (for example: Someone had just start to reading the following post right now: link)

The most of the users will click on it and the next users will get the notification again. With this method you will increase vastly the average session time. (you can specify the notification redisplay time in minutes)

Of course, the plugin has a lot of more benefits. You can set adverts to every category. The WP User Tracker Pro can track the most visited categories for each user and they will get a targeted adverts by category with this method. You can save unlimited adverts for categories. If you save more than one to each category, the plugin will display by random order.
You can track all of the visited posts, pages and categories by today, yesterday, this week, last week, this month, last month and all time. If you don't want to display the inbuilt Counter Widget, you can view the counter's datas on the admin page. The widget datas are customizable, you can enable or disable the all time, this month, this week and today visitors, if you wish.

Possible to display the most viewed posts and pages widget with customizable number of elements and you can find a separated widget for the most viewed categories as well.

I hope you will enjoy the features of the plugin!
